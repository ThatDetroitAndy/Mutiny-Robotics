# Mutiny-Robotics
A system for controlling a robot through Tiktok Live by the general public.

You'll need Visual Studio 2022 and Arduino IDE for the code and also you'll need a MQTT broker like https://mosquitto.org/ or https://www.rabbitmq.com/, we use Mosquitto becase is less painful sometimes maybe.
